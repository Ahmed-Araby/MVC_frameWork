# how php deal with passing arrays to functions (lazy copy, copy on right).

**************************************
regular expressions:
"/expression/"

meta character:
\d -- match only one digits 
\w -- match only one of a-z or A-Z or 0-9 
\s -- match only one of white space char (space, tap) 

special characters:
^ -- start of the string 
$ -- end of the string
* after a char -- repeated 0 or more.
+ after a char -- repeated 1 or more 
.  -- matches any single character (letter, number, white space .. etc)
.* -- wild card match --- match any thing any number of times or zero times.
\ -- scape a special character if we want to match it as a normal character.

notes:
regeular expressions are case sensitive.
adding "i" after the regex  will make the match case insensitive.
like this --> $reg = "/^abc/i";

"i" after the regx is called a modifier.


character sets and ranges:
[] -- denote a character set 
this will match any of the characters inside the [] 
it is also to compine it with repeation characters (*, +)
[1-5]  -- match any character inside the range.
[0-9a-z]  -- more than 1 possible range to search in.
[^123]  -- negated char set , this will match any expect 123
[^0-9]  -- will not match any digits.

capture Groups:
extracts parts of the strings using regular expression.
() --- define a group to be extracted during the matching of the expression.

named capture groups:
(?<name>regexPart to be named)  -- this a named group that could be inside a bigger regex.

replacements:
using preg_replace();

backreference to capture group -- refere to the capture group by its occurance:
\1 -- first one 
\2 -- second one
\n --- such that n is the number of groups in the matching groups of my regex, as they all have to be found 
at the same time to say that I have a match.

special chars:
{ 
}
\
/  -- forward slash is a special character for regex pattern as the pattern itself enclosed whithin 
        forward slashes.
        

so we need to scape them

and so on.
built in functions for regular expression operations:
1- preg_match(, , $matches)
matches  -- will have the first string that matches our regex.

**************************************


nameSpaces:
php looks for classes relative to the current namespace 
namespace app;

x= new dateTime(); // php will see it as new app\dateTime as if class date time is inside app namespace

auto loading make use of 
folders directory that matches with the namespace
one class per file 
class name is the same as the file name


in auto loading -- the loading is happining relative to the position of the autoloader file.


when working with files that have include/require using the command line 
the relative path of the command line affect the path of the require/include    


include_once __DIR__ . "\..\autoload.php";
this allow you to include the path always relative to the absolute path of the 
calling file.


__call() magic method
this method will be called when we call private or non exist method 



htmlspecialchars("") --- will scape special characters and  print the string as plain text 
not html parising will be applied.



call_user_func_array --- call a method with paramters as array 




# composer:

* composer install -- will download the libriries we need and mentioned in 
        composer.json 

* composer requrie "lib info "   -- will download and add it to composer.json/require field



each package have it's own autoloader 

composer can auto load what ever was installed with it -- I believe composer does this 
by mapping as there is no such geneeric way, also the package don't make namespaces 
corresponding to the file paths.

my auto load is not generic loader



# autoloading my own classes with composer:
{
        "autoload":{
                "classmap":{
                        "here is the file path that would be automatically included", 
                        ""
                }
        }
}

- psr-4 (map namespace to path in the file system relative to the root of the project )
- classmap

composer dump-autoload -->>> to update the autoload file of composer.
