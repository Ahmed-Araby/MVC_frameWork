regular expressions:
"/expression/"

meta character:
\d -- match only one digits 
\w -- match only one of a-z or A-Z or 0-9 
\s -- match only one of white space char (space, tap) 

special characters:
^ -- start of the string 
$ -- end of the string
* after a char -- repeated 0 or more.
+ after a char -- repeated 1 or more 
.  -- matches any single character (letter, number, white space .. etc)
.* -- wild card match --- match any thing any number of times or zero times.
\ -- scape a special character if we want to match it as a normal character.

notes:
regeular expressions are case sensitive.
adding "i" after the regex  will make the match case insensitive.
like this --> $reg = "/^abc/i";

"i" after the regx is called a modifier.


character sets and ranges:
[] -- denote a character set 
this will match any of the characters inside the [] 
it is also to compine it with repeation characters (*, +)
[1-5]  -- match any character inside the range.
[0-9a-z]  -- more than 1 possible range to search in.
[^123]  -- negated char set , this will match any expect 123
[^0-9]  -- will not match any digits.

capture Groups:
extracts parts of the strings using regular expression.
() --- define a group to be extracted during the matching of the expression.

named capture groups:
(?<name>regexPart to be named)  -- this a named group that could be inside a bigger regex.

replacements:
using preg_replace();

backreference to capture group -- refere to the capture group by its occurance:
\1 -- first one 
\2 -- second one
\n --- such that n is the number of groups in the matching groups of my regex, as they all have to be found 
at the same time to say that I have a match.

special chars:
{ 
}
\
/  -- forward slash is a special character for regex pattern as the pattern itself enclosed whithin 
        forward slashes.
        

so we need to scape them

and so on.
built in functions for regular expression operations:
1- preg_match(, , $matches)
matches  -- will have the first string that matches our regex.
